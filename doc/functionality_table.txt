Here is functionality table. I've managed to do all functionalities, which have + next to them.
These are: things for 25 points + list syntax sugar + bonus (polimorphic types reconstruction algorithm).


For 20 points
  + 01 (two types)
  + 02 (arithmetical operations, comparison)
  + 03 (if clause)
  + 04 (functions with multiple arguments, recurrency)
  + 05 (anonymous functions, higher order functions and partial application)
  + 06 (run-time errors)
  Lists:
    07 (with pattern matching)
  + 08 (built-in operations)
  + 09 ("syntax sugar")
  
For 25 points
  + 10 (lists of any type, nested lists and lists of functions)
    11 (simple algebraic types with one level pattern matching)
  + 12 (static identifier binding)
  + 13 (static typing)

For 30 points
  14 (polymorphic and recurrency algebraic types) 
  15 (nested pattern matching, complete test)

Bonus
  + 16 (polymorphic types reconstruction algorithm)

+ additional list functions: concat, empty
+ olol's library with some useful functions (more list operations, filp)
